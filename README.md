See our app here! 
Deployed at: https://galaxy-getaway.herokuapp.com/

## Project Description

Who doesnâ€™t want to schedule their own trip to space? Galaxy Getaway users can login and schedule their own trip to space. They will choose locations to visit and then be able to virtually tour the locations.

### Homepage

On the homepage users can see reviews and decide to book a trip or contact the team.

### Selection Page

Users will see and select up to 6 different sites using checkboxes to choose on their space trip. Once they have chosen which sites to visit, they will enter a username and password and click the "start your trip" button to be sent to the next page.

### Trip Page

The trip begins here at the Trip page! Here users are presented with photos and information about the sites they chose to visit when booking their trip. This page features anywhere from 1 to 6 sites to visit, depending on user selection. Users can also select sites to be saved to their favorites and revisited later.

### End page

After the trip is complete, the user lands on this page where they can follow links to view their favorites, contact our team, or book another trip.

### Favorites page

The favorites page displays any sites the user chose to add to their favorites during their trip.

### Contact page

This page contains a form that users can fill out to get in touch with the team.
