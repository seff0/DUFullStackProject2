      "Stephenson 2-18 is the largest known star in our galaxy. It’s considered a ‘red supergiant’, located in the constellation of Scutum, and it’s over 2100 times larger than our sun. If it were placed where our sun is, in the center of our solar system, it would be large enough for its photosphere (its ‘surface’) to reach Saturn.");
